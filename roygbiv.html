    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Roy G. Biv Color Drop is color-filled carnival game that combines the mechanisms of Plinko and Foosball. The game requires two players. Each player picks a board and assembles the pieces at the top 
        of the board. The objective is to get the ball in the center bin and score the most points. However, once 
        the pieces are placed, players drop the ball down from the top of the board and the other player attempts 
        to block it from the middle. The player who scores the most points wins! Players can earn prizes by getting 
        a higher difference in score.</p>
        <h2>Technical Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This game consists of two wooden boards with an internal ramp system. An acrylic door is attatched to the
             side of the board for easy access to the pieces, while having the ability to close so that the ball can 
             properly drop. The back part of the board is lined with felt, and laser cut pieces can be attached using Velcro. 
             Underneath the felt is the foosball system that consists of 3D printed goalies attatched to a wooden dowel.
            At the base of the board is a scoring system that uses buttons to print the score to an LCD screen, once the ball hits it.</p>

    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <p>My main contribution was laser cutting the acrylic blocker pieces and the doors. With the rest of the group, I assembled the boards together. I also 
        took charge of designing aesthetic components like the wire cover, poster, and our mascot: Roy G. Biv.</p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>This project taught me the value of testing. Through multiple rounds of playtesting, we were able notice faults in our design. Originally, the
         pieces were intended to be magnetic, but having to place the pieces on magnets restricted the flexibility of play. To fix this issue, the backing
          of the board was changed to felt, and pieces were attached to the board by Velcro.<br><br>
          I also learned about the value of setting timelines. With so many different components distributed amongst the team, it was imperative that we got
           certain components done well ahead the deadline so that we can assemble the rest. It was sometimes be a struggle to finish on time, but it taught 
           me to communicate better about when things were getting done, and prioritize parts that are attatched to other pieces first.
