    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Moving to a new place and knowing barely anyone at school was an experience that my team and I shared. We wanted to develop a social application to post spontaneous events for fellow classmates to join, and thus Fren was born.</p>
        <h2>Technical Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Currently we have a simple app design, and the workings of a functional app programmed using Swift UI.</p>

    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <p>I was in charge of wireframing and prototyping the user interface of the application. I also did brand design for the app name and logo.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Right before I presented my designs for this project, I realized I completely forgot to put spaces to set times and dates. This experience made me more attentive to my future application designs and consider what users need more deeply in order to properly interact with the app.
        <br><br>After the first few weeks, some of the team decided not to continue with the project. Therefore, the 
        outcome isnâ€™t as functional as I had originally hoped. Regardless, this process taught me a lot about interactivity in mobile applications, and built a foundation for how to proceed with creating a fully functional app in the future.</p>
