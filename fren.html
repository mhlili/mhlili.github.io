    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Moving to a new place and knowing barely anyone at school was an struggle that my team and I faced when coming to our university. We wanted to develop a social application to post spontaneous events for fellow classmates to join, and thus Fren was born.</p>
        <h2>Technical Outcomes</h2>
        <p>We designed wireframes using Miro and Figma to plan the layout of key interfaces of the application, and implemented the interfaces in Swift UI. We also implemented a secure authentication system using Supabase.</p>

    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <p>I was in charge of wireframing, prototyping, and implementing the user interface of the application. I also designed the app name and logo.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Right before I presented my designs for this project, I realized I completely forgot to put spaces to set times and dates. This experience made me more attentive to my future application designs and consider what users need more deeply in order to properly interact with the app.
        <br><br>Ultimately this experience taught me a lot about interactivity in mobile applications, and built a foundation for the structure and technology needed to develop mobile applications.</p>
