    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Stitch Loop is a mobile app that combines habit tracking, closet organization, and social networking to simplify usersâ€™ lives and promote sustainability. The app encourages users to integrate sustainable practices into 
        their fashion choices by making it a social endeavor. On a personal level, users can upload photos, descriptions, and prices of their clothing items to create a digital wardrobe. Each day, they can use this wardrobe to 
        assemble outfit pages in a scrapbook-style format, documenting the clothing items worn. The app then calculates a cost-per-wear value for each item based on how often it's worn. If an item goes unworn for a certain period, 
        it is flagged, and the user is notified. If the piece remains unworn after a specified time, it's listed for sale on Stitch Loop's marketplace. The social media tab allows users to view others' daily outfits for fashion 
        inspiration. The transactions tab displays items available for sale, where users can make payment offers or trade items.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Outcomes</h2>
        <p>The current application takes the form of a Figma prototype. The prototype replicates the main experiences that the user would get from the real application.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>My initial idea for the app was inspired by dress up games. People would be able to choose their avatar, and dress it up using the clothing in their digital wardrobe. It also used to be more focused on the habit tracking aspect
        as a way to make users more mindful of clothes that haven't been worn. Since then, it has developed into more of a social media platform with a greater emphasis on circularity. Initially, the social media aspect was purely for 
        outfit inspiration. However, the shop is now integrated into the social media platform, which encourages the development of a community of fashion lovers who want to circulate unworn clothing amongst each other.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Mobile applications have a great potential for tactical media interventions. Apps enable us to easily create and consume media from a device that many of us are on 24/7. This project helped me better understand the key 
        functionality of mobile apps as a means to track habits, connect with other people, and work toward improving the planet, consciously and subconsciously.
