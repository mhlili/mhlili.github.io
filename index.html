        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <h3>My name is Maggie Lee. I am a second year at Northeastern University studying 
            <span>Computer Engineering</span> and <span>Interaction Design</span>.</h3>
        <p>I'm driven by products made with intention. Therefore, I put immense effort and 
            thoughtfulness into everything I create and take part in. To implement my ideas 
            without limitations on technical ability, I work hard to be a quick learner. 
            Over the years, I have developed strong programming skills, particularly in <span>Java</span> 
            and <span>HTML</span>, and more working knowledge in <span>C++</span>, <span>Python</span>, and <span>Kotlin</span>. I am also proficient 
            in design software including <span>Figma</span>, <span>AutoCAD</span>, <span>SolidWorks</span>, <span>Adobe InDesign</span>, and <span>Adobe Illustrator</span>. More recently, I have become involved in creating more physical projects, 
            where I have developed skills in <span>Arduino</span>, <span>laser cutting</span>, <span>soldering</span>, and general <span>prototype 
                fabrication</span>.</p>
